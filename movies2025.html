			<h1>üçø 100 Movies in 2025 üé¨</h1>
			<p>One of my personal goals for 2025 is to watch 100 new movies. I won't be listing previously watched movies here, just new-to-me ones. I'll be rating them as I watch, and I may try to leave a small comment as a review as well.</p>
			<p>A note about ratings - movies are enjoyable! A rating of 3 stars means I don't regret spending time with a movie. Five stars doesn't mean perfect, just that I enjoyed it enough to rank it among my favorite movies, so I'm hoping there may be some inflation involved, but don't worry about it too much.</p>

		<p>I had to watch this movie in two sittings, half way through the first sitting I fell asleep.</p>
		<p>That's not to say that the first half was boring - I was really in love with it. Having Cooper explore and exploit the auditorium was thrilling, I thought showing the dichotomy between manipulating serial killer and well meaning person was handled brilliantly with the closeups during dialog. As soon as the movie leaves the venue behind the movie was completely trashed for me. Imagine if half way through Die Hard they decide to ditch Nakatomi Plaza, or if Jack and family leave The Overlook Hotel - what could have been one of my favorite movies in the list turned into one of the most disappointing.</p>
		<p>Bummer!</p>

		<p>Although the amount of gruff one-liners got to be a bit obnoxious, it was cool to have a big Hollywood movie with a lot of WWII flight action. Wasn't as much of a spectacle as the latest Top Gun, but a few of the bombing runs had me pretty enthralled.</p>
		<p>The acting was left to fight with some pretty bad writing - like I mentioned, the one-liners that were meant to highlight the heroism of our WWII vets felt absurd within the first 30 minutes of watching. I feel like a movie can only support a handful of memorable one-liners, and anything past that just feels almost satirical. I've been on a Asano kick lately, rewatching films like Taste of Tea and Mongol, and was disappointed to see him get so little screen time - as a fan I would have loved to see him flesh out his character a bit more.</p>
		<p>Still a fun watch, interesting from a historical standpoint, and filled with lots of spectacle.</p>

		A pretty standard cold war espionage movie. It's an interesting story that claims to be true, but it exists in a medium where tension and paranoia have been portrayed so amazingly that it felt a bit boring. The acting was fine!

		Growing up I loved Gundam, and gorged myself on quite a few series and movies and games and model kits. This movie definitely hit on some nostalgia in the first half which made the experience for me. The second half had some style and cool action, some fun characters and a cool soundtrack, but it really felt like the first couple of episodes of a TV series. Apparently that is the case, but I was hoping that this movie could stand on its own!

			Enjoyed the push and pull of information being given to me, given to characters, being withheld from me, withheld from characters. Made the scenario feel very surreal and realistic simultaneously.

		<p>A good movie about the trials and tribulations of selling your car.</p>
		<p>Really, though, was looking forward to Nicholas Hoult, but found his acting or character to be pretty cardboard - other actors really did great though - J.K. Simmons and Cedric Yarbrough were my highlights. The story was fine, I think the ending was a bit meh - there was a scene at a window minutes earlier that I think would have made a better ending.</p>

		This movie affected me in certain ways because of who I am and what I believe in. It served as a really great story that reminds me of the things I dislike about the world and things I really love in it. When it comes to nuance, the world the movie portrays lacks it, but the main character was built with it.

		title="Wolfs"
		year="2024"
		rating="4"
		watch-date="3/2/2025"
		imdb-id="tt14257582"
	>
		<p>Really enjoyed this movie, but I feel like it didn't quite commit to what it could have been. It started off very strong, exterior tracking shots felt like a grimy-Wes-Anderson-esque motif of different shadowboxes vignetting a cold New York block. The action had that cinematic-first feel that you might get from Edgar Wright. In fact, I think you can sum up my feelings about commitment with this movie by comparing two similar scenes - When the two "wolfs" get in the car to chase the naked guy, and when Jon Bernthal's character gets into Baby's car in Baby Driver. The point-forward-drive-in-reverse gag is exactly the same, but Baby Driver's is just so much snappier and stylish. Another thing that comes to mind is the soundtrack; Wolfs' soundtrack is nearly great, and shines in the beginning half or so of the movie, switching up between Quiet Storm soft jazz throwbacks that define the taste of the elder wolf and dark mysterious synthy piano incidental music that felt almost like a callback to my personal favorite Clooney-Pitt movie: Burn After Reading, but by the end of the movie the plucky tongue-in-cheek motifs that followed the Wolfs' constant eye-rolling at each other felt a little too on-the-nose.</p>
		<p>Overall I didn't expect much more than Clooney-Pitt fan-service - they definitely have a ton of on-screen chemistry to exploit - but was very impressed by tight cinematography, lots of unique action-comedy, and incredibly acted supporting cast - Amy Ryan, Austin Abrams, and Poorna Jagannathan all gave the film's world a ton of enjoyable depth.</p>

		A very tense ride through many different facets of white nationalism and a pretty decent undercover cop drama. Radcliffe was definitely the highlight but it was well acted all around. It was interesting how the film highlighted so many different archetypes around white nationalism - the generic skin-heads, the militiamen, the under the radar white collar suburbanites, even the opportunists.

		Not really the kind of movie that sticks with me, but the cast was excellent and there was a handful of really funny moments.

		A short that demonstrates extreme competency in using moving images to portray comedy, action, and glam rock. I saw a picture of Tadanobu Asano and got sidetracked looking up actors from Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl, and found Ryusei-Kacho. It wasn't until I finished watching that I saw that this film was directed by Hideaki Anno. Very cool!

		Really loved the match of Eisenberg's David and Culkin's Benji, it very much resonated with a lot of relationships I've had in life in a way that made the whole film personally enjoyable.

		Yep, got suckered in by a new Will Ferrell comedy. Pretty predictably lousy rom com with a handful of laughs from Will's unhinged comedy, and I enjoy his unhinged comedy, but it feels patronizing when the foil has no straight man I guess? Celia Weston and Keyla Monterroso Mejia were two standouts, everything else was meh.

		I thought Cosmic Dawn was overall an enjoyable watch. The film jumps between two time periods, which felt pretty jarring at the offset but I really loved as the plot unfolded. The ending felt a bit unearned, but hit a few notes well.

		year="1977"
		rating="4.5"
		watch-date="1/29/2025"
		imdb-id="tt0076786"
	>
		<p>Excellent movie with a nightmarish feel. Light plays a huge role in the impact, so the sets and cinematography will leave a huge impression. The music from Goblin is also unbelievable - I have been a fan of theirs for years and have listened to the Suspiria soundtrack several times but until hearing it along with the film I wouldn't have thought it would be so remarkable.</p>
		<p>It's great to see something like this that feels like a shout in a cave that has been echoed by great filmmakers like Lynch and Kubrick.</p>
		<p>The plot of Suspiria isn't groundbreaking, but I feel like it doesn't need to be - the film exceeds in every way that makes film a unique medium, so I feel like the movie is an immense success.</p>
		<p>I've talked myself into giving it another half star :)</p>

	>
		The Sonic games have always gravitated away from the special sauce that made the original games great, losing more and more of their identity over time. The Sonic movies are trending in the opposite direction - the first movie felt like it was embarrassed to be a Sonic movie, instead it donned as much of a milquetoast American suburban aesthetic as possible. As we get into Sonic 3, the series is starting to get some character (carried almost entirely by Jim Carrey's Eggman). Still not something I'd like to watch without my kids, but it kept them entertained and there's something great about snuggling with your kids while watching a movie about a cartoon character you grew up played take on an actor you grew up watching, even if it's a bit watered down.
